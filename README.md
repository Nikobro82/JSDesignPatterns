/*You will see that there are multiple folders that have seperate names, this is used to divide the types of design patterns.
Creational design patterns are usually used when creating objects, such as multiple enemies in a game.
Structural design patterns deal with how they relate to each other, like grouping multiple objects together.
Behavioral design patterns are how objects communicate with each other.

If you have any questions let me know.
